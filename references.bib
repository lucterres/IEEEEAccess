	abstract = {Much work has been done on the assessment of texture descriptors for image retrieval in many domains. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy and performance of three wellknown texture descriptors - Gabor Filters, {GLCM}, and {LBP} - for seismic image retrieval. These subsurface images pose challenges yet not thoroughly investigated in previous works, which are addressed and evaluated in our experiments. We asked for domain experts to annotate two seismic cubes, Penobscot 3D and Netherlands F3, and used them to evaluate texture descriptors, corresponding parameters, and similarity metrics with the potential to retrieve visually similar regions of the considered datasets. While {GLCM} is used in the vast majority of works in this area, our findings indicate that {LBP} has the potential to produce satisfying results with lower computational cost.},

	abstract = {Local Binary Pattern ({LBP}) is an effective method for texture analysis, being appreciated for accuracy and computing power. The {LBP} operator is invariant to illumination and contrast changes in the image. Intensity Histogram is a simple method used to compare images with the advantage of being insensitive to small changes of camera position. The biggest disadvantage for this technique is that it provides no spatial information. The accuracy of Intensity Histogram can be increased by using a Color Coherence Vector ({CCV}). {CCV} partitions the histogram buckets based on spatial coherence. The paper presents those techniques in detail as well as and a comparison between the results of applying them on a set of ultrasounds images.},
